## Generative art: what

> One overly simple but useful definition is that generative art is art programmed using a computer that intentionally introduces randomness as part of its creation process.
>
>[Jason Bailey](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art)

- There is randomness to the art, introduced by the computer (the code)
- The artist has control over the randomness, as contradictory as that may sound

---

## Generative art: why

- Why people create generative art pieces?
  - Artistic expression
  - Leveraging computers to generate randomness
  - ...

--
- Why are we learning about generative art?
  - A different look at data visualization: not for the meaning in the data, but for the visual itself
  - Great way to practice programming, particularly if you're into creating art
  - Opportunity to practice problem solving skills, particularly if you're sketching first, then creating or reproducing an existing piece

---

## Generative art in use: Book covers

Just one of many examples of generative art as a practical solution by the New York Public Library:

To fill in missing book covers in an ebook-borrowing and reading app 

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Generative-book-covers.png")
```

## Let's make a circle

.pull-left[
```{r circle-points, fig.show = "hide"}
# make a circle of points
t <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 50)
x <- sin(t)
y <- cos(t)
df <- tibble(t, x, y)

# plot a circle of points
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "circle-points", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "100%"}

```
]

---

## The Golden Angle

.pull-left[
The golden angle is the angle subtended by the smaller (red) arc when two arcs that make up a circle are in the golden ratio.

$$ \pi(3 − \sqrt{5}) $$

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Golden_Angle.png")
```
]
--
.pull-right[
The golden angle is the angle separating successive florets on a sunflower.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Goldener_Schnitt_Blattstand.png")
```
]

## Petals with the golden angle

.pull-left[
```{r golden-paths, fig.show = "hide"}
# set golden angle
angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

# set number of points
points <- 50

# make data frame
df <- tibble(
  i = 1:points,
  t = (1:points) * angle,
  x = sin(t),
  y = cos(t)
)

# plot points in a spiral
ggplot(df, aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_path(color = "gray") +
  geom_text(aes(label = i)) +
  coord_equal()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "golden-paths", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "100%"}

```
]

---

## Paths to points

.pull-left[
```{r golden-points, fig.show = "hide"}
# set golden angle
angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

# set number of points
points <- 50

# make data frame
df <- tibble(
  i = 1:points,
  t = (1:points) * angle,
  x = sin(t),
  y = cos(t)
)

# plot points in a spiral
ggplot(df, aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() + #<<
  coord_equal()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "golden-points", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "100%"}

```
]

---

## Without the background

.pull-left[
```{r golden-points-void, fig.show = "hide"}
# set golden angle
angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

# set number of points
points <- 50

# make data frame
df <- tibble(
  i = 1:points,
  t = (1:points) * angle,
  x = sin(t),
  y = cos(t)
)

# plot points in a spiral
ggplot(df, aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void() #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "golden-points-void", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "100%"}

```
]

---

## More points

.pull-left[
```{r golden-points-more-void, fig.show = "hide"}
# set golden angle
angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

# set number of points
points <- 100 #<<

# make data frame
df <- tibble(
  i = 1:points,
  t = (1:points) * angle,
  x = sin(t),
  y = cos(t)
)

# plot points in a spiral
ggplot(df, aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "golden-points-more-void", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "100%"}

```
]

---

## Adjust points

.pull-left[
```{r golden-points-more-void-adjust, fig.show = "hide"}
# set golden angle
angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

# set number of points
points <- 100

# make data frame
df <- tibble(
  i = 1:points,
  t = (1:points) * angle + 20, #<<
  x = sin(t),
  y = cos(t)
)

# plot points in a spiral
ggplot(df, aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void()

```

# Formalize a system

---

## Write a function: `build_art()`

```{r}
build_art <- function() {

  # set golden angle
  angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

  # set number of points
  points <- 100

  # make data frame
  tibble(
    i = 1:points,
    t = (1:points) * angle + 20,
    x = sin(t),
    y = cos(t)
  )
}
```

---

## Add arguments to `build_art()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
build_art <- function(points,
                      angle,
                      adjustment) {
  tibble(
    i = 1:points,
    t = (1:points) * angle + adjustment,
    x = sin(t),
    y = cos(t)
  )
}
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
build_art(
  angle = pi * (3 - sqrt(5)),
  points = 100,
  adjustment = 20
)
```
]

---

## Use the function

.pull-left[
```{r points-100, fig.show = "hide"}
build_art(
  angle = pi * (3 - sqrt(5)),
  points = 100,
  adjustment = 20
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "points-100", echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.asp = 1}

```
]

---

## Change parameters

.pull-left[
```{r points-500, fig.show = "hide"}
build_art(
  angle = 3, #<<
  points = 500, #<<
  adjustment = 0 #<<
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "points-500", echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.asp = 1}

```
]
