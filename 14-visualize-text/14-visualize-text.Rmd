## 

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
love_actually <- read_csv(here::here("14-visualize-text", "data/love-actually.csv"))
```

.task[
Do you recognize the following text?
]

<br>

>Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow airport. General opinion started to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. Seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy but it's always there. Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from people on board were messages of hate or revenge, they were all messages of love. If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling, you'll find that love actually is all around.

---

## Text as data

Text can be represented as data in a variery of ways:

- String: Character vector

- Corpus: Raw strings annotated with additional metadata and details

- Document-term matrix: Sparse matrix describing a collection (i.e., a corpus) of documents with one row for each document and one column for each term, with word counts (or another measure of how common the word is in that text) as values

---

## Tidy text

- Each row is a **token**
  - A token can be a word, bigram (two words), ngram (n words), sentence, paragraph, etc.
- Each column is a variable
- Each type of observational unit is a table

```{r}
love_actually %>%
  slice_head(n = 6)
```

---

## Tokenize into words

With `tidytext::unnest_tokens()`:

```{r}
love_actually %>%
  unnest_tokens(
    output = word,    # first argument is output
    input = dialogue, # second argument is input
    token = "words"   # third argument is token, with default "words"
    )
```

---

## Most common words

.task[
Why do these words appear so commonly in Love Actually?
]

```{r}
love_actually %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, dialogue) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

---

## Stop words

- In computing, stop words are words which are filtered out before or after processing of natural language data (text)

- They usually refer to Most common words in a language, but there is not a single list of stop words used by all natural language processing tools

.pull-left[
English:
.small[
```{r}
get_stopwords()
```
]
]
.pull-right[
Spanish:
.small[
```{r}
get_stopwords()
```
]
]

---

## Most common words

```{r}
love_actually %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, dialogue) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

---

## Portuguese?!

```{r}
love_actually %>%
  filter(str_detect(dialogue, "[Pp]ortuguese"))
```

---

## Data cleaning

- Remove language identifiers

```{r}
love_actually <- love_actually %>%
  mutate(dialogue = str_remove(dialogue, "(Portuguese)"))
```

- Take another look

```{r}
love_actually %>%
  filter(str_detect(dialogue, "[Pp]ortuguese"))
```

---

## Most common words

without "Portuguese"

```{r}
love_actually %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, dialogue) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

---

## Visualizing Most common words

Visualize the top 10 words

.panelset.sideways[
```{r panelset = c(source = "Code", output = "Plot"), out.width = "100%", message = FALSE}
love_actually %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, dialogue) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(y = word, x = n)) +
  geom_col()
```
]

---

## Visualizing Most common words

Reorder the words by frequency

.panelset.sideways[
```{r panelset = c(source = "Code", output = "Plot"), out.width = "100%", message = FALSE}
love_actually %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, dialogue) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(word, n), x = n)) + #<<
  geom_col()
```
]

---

## Visualizing Most common words

Bring in some color

.panelset.sideways[
```{r panelset = c(source = "Code", output = "Plot"), out.width = "100%", message = FALSE}
love_actually %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, dialogue) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(word, n), x = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#BD2D2A") + #<<
  labs(
    x = "Count", y = NULL,
    title = "Most common words in Love Actually"
  )
```
]

---

## Visualizing the most common words

Use `ggtext::element_textbox_simple()` to add color to title

.panelset.sideways[
```{r panelset = c(source = "Code", output = "Plot"), out.width = "100%", message = FALSE}
love_actually %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, dialogue) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(word, n), x = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#BD2D2A") +
  labs(
    x = "Count", y = NULL,
    title = "<span style = 'color:#808080'>Most common words in</span>", #<<
    subtitle ="<span style = 'color:#BD2D2A;font-weight:strong'><b>love</b></span> actually" #<<
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_textbox_simple(halign = 1), #<<
    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 30, halign = 1), #<<
    plot.title.position = "plot" #<<
    )
```
]

---

## Wordclouds

Using `ggwordcloud::geom_text_wordcloud()`:

.panelset.sideways[
```{r panelset = c(source = "Code", output = "Plot"), out.width = "100%", message = FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
love_actually %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = dialogue) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(label = word, size = n)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 10)
```
]

---

## Wordclouds, with color

.panelset.sideways[
```{r panelset = c(source = "Code", output = "Plot"), out.width = "100%", message = FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
love_actually %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = dialogue) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(label = word, size = n)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud(aes(color = n)) +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 10) +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "Reds")

# Network data

---

## Network data

- A **network** refers to an object composed of elements and relationships or connections between those elements

--
- **Network analysis** is a collection of techniques for examining the relationships between entities, and depicting the structure of those relationships
  - Network analysis spans a number of domains, including social networks, bibliometrics, epidemiology, bioinformatics, complex systems, and text analysis

--
- **Graph theory** provides the formal basis for network analysis, across domains, and provides a common language for describing the structure of networks

--
- **Network visualization** involves the visualization of the relationships (edges or links) between data elements (nodes)

---

## Purpose

Main concern in designing a network visualization is the purpose it has to serve:

- What are the structural properties that we want to highlight?
- What are the key concerns we want to address?

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/network-purpose.png")
```

.footnote[
Source: https://kateto.net/network-visualization
]

---

## Format

- Network maps are not the only visualization appropriate for graphs

- Other network representation formats, including simple charts of key characteristics, may be more appropriate in some cases

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/network-format.png")
```

## Bigrams as tokens

**Bigram** is a sequence of two adjacent elements ferom a string of tokens, e.g., two consecutive words

```{r}
bigrams <- love_actually %>%
  unnest_tokens(bigram, dialogue, token = "ngrams", n = 2)

bigrams
```

---

## Most common bigrams

```{r}
bigrams %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE)
```

---

## Removing stop words from bigrams

Step 1: Separate the bigram into words

```{r}
bigrams_separated <- bigrams %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")

bigrams_separated
```

---

## Removing stop words from bigrams

Step 2: Remove bigram if either word is a stop word

```{r}
bigrams_filtered <- bigrams_separated %>%
  filter(!(word1 %in% stop_words$word)) %>%
  filter(!(word2 %in% stop_words$word))

bigrams_filtered
```

---

## Removing stop words from bigrams

Step 3: Put the bigrams back together

```{r}
bigrams_united <- bigrams_filtered %>%
  unite(bigram, word1, word2, sep = " ")

bigrams_united
```

---

## Most common bigrams, again

Hmm...

```{r}
bigrams_united %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE)
```

---

## Most common bigrams, again

```{r}
bigrams_united <- bigrams_united %>%
  filter(bigram != "NA NA")

bigrams_united %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE)
```

---

## Visualizing the most common bigrams

.panelset.sideways[
```{r panelset = c(source = "Code", output = "Plot"), out.width = "100%", message = FALSE}
bigrams_united %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(bigram, n), x = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#BD2D2A") +
  labs(
    x = "Count", y = NULL,
    title = "<span style = 'color:#808080'>Most common bigrams in</span>", #<<
    subtitle ="<span style = 'color:#BD2D2A;font-weight:strong'><b>love</b></span> actually" #<<
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_textbox_simple(halign = 1), #<<
    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 30, halign = 1), #<<
    plot.title.position = "plot" #<<
    )
```
]

---

## Network of bigrams

- We may be interested in visualizing all of the relationships among words simultaneously, rather than just the top few at a time

- One approach is to arrange the words into a network (or "graph")
  - Here, "graph" is not in the sense of a visualization, but as a combination of connected nodes
  
- A graph can be constructed from a tidy object since it has three variables:
  - **from**: the node an edge is coming from
  - **to**: the node an edge is going towards
  - **weight**: a numeric value associated with each edge

---

## From tidy data frame to graph

Using `igraph::graph_from_data_frame()`:

```{r}
bigram_graph <- bigrams_united %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 1) %>%       # filter for bigrams that occur more than once
  graph_from_data_frame()

bigram_graph
```

---

## Visualizing the network of bigrams

Common bigrams in Love Actually that occurred more than once and where neither word was a stop word

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1)
```

---

## Visualizing the network of bigrams

Step 1. Set up the plot object with `ggraph::ggraph()`:

```{r out.width = "75%"}
set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph)
```

---

## Visualizing the network of bigrams

Step 2. Add edges

```{r out.width = "50%"}
set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph) +
  geom_edge_link()
```

---

## Visualizing the network of bigrams

Step 3. Add nodes

```{r out.width = "50%"}
set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph) +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point()
```

---

## Visualizing the network of bigrams

Step 4. Add text

```{r out.width = "45%"}
set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph) +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name))
```

---

## Visualizing the network of bigrams

Step 5. Consider layouts

```{r out.width = "35%", echo = FALSE}
set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name)) +
  labs(title = "layout: stress")

set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name)) +
  labs(title = "layout: fr")
```

```{r out.width = "35%", echo = FALSE}
set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "lgl") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name)) +
  labs(title = "layout: lgl")

set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "graphopt") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name)) +
  labs(title = "layout: graphopt")
```

---

## Visualizing the network of bigrams

Step 6. Pick a layout

```{r out.width = "50%"}
set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name))
```

---

## Visualizing the network of bigrams

Step 7. Adjust text

```{r out.width = "50%"}
set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), hjust = 1, vjust = 1)
```

---

## Visualizing the network of bigrams

Step 8. Add more context with `edge_alpha = n`

.panelset.sideways[
```{r panelset = c(source = "Code", output = "Plot"), out.width = "100%", message = FALSE}
a <- grid::arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(0.1, "inches"))

set.seed(1015)
ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n), show.legend = FALSE,
                 arrow = a, end_cap = circle(0.01, "inches")) +
  geom_node_point(color = "lightpink", size = 3) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1)
```
]

---

## Main characters

```{r message = FALSE}
main_characters <- read_csv(here::here("14-visualize-text", "data/love-actually-cast.csv"))
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
main_characters %>% slice(1:10)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
main_characters %>% slice(11:20)
```
]

---

## Dialogues for main characters

```{r}
love_actually <- love_actually %>%
  inner_join(main_characters) %>%
  mutate(character = glue("{speaker} ({actor})"))

dim(love_actually)
```

---

## Lines-per-scene-per-character

```{r}
character_scene_counts <- love_actually %>%
    count(scene, character)

character_scene_counts
```

---

## Look who's talking to whom

```{r}
character_scene_counts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = scene, y = character)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path(aes(group = scene))
```

---

## Identify monologues

```{r}
character_scene_counts %>%
  group_by(scene) %>%
  mutate(conversation = if_else(n() == 1, "monologue", "not monologue"))
```

---

## Look who's talking to whom, again

.task[
What's happening in the last scene?
]

.panelset.sideways[
```{r panelset = c(source = "Code", output = "Plot"), out.width = "100%", message = FALSE}
character_scene_counts %>%
  group_by(scene) %>%
  mutate(conversation = if_else(n() == 1, "monologue", "not monologue")) %>%
  filter(conversation == "not monologue") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = scene, y = character)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path(aes(group = scene))
```
]

---

## Remove the last scene

So that it doesn't look like everyone is connected to each other in the network

```{r}
character_scene_counts <- character_scene_counts %>%
  filter(scene != max(character_scene_counts$scene))
```

---

## Character scene "matrix"

Each row is a character, each column is a scene

.small[
```{r}
character_scene_counts %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = scene,
    values_from = n
  )
```
]

---

## Character scene "matrix"

... and each cell is a 0/1 depending on whether that combination ever occurred

.small[
```{r}
character_scene_occurences <- character_scene_counts %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = scene,
    names_prefix = "s",
    values_from = n,
    values_fn = length,
    values_fill = 0
  )

character_scene_occurences
```
]

---

## Actually as a matrix

.small[
```{r}
character_scene_matrix <- character_scene_occurences %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "character") %>%
  as.matrix()

character_scene_matrix
```
]

---

## Calculate co-occurrences

.small[
```{r}
cooccur <- character_scene_matrix %*% t(character_scene_matrix)

cooccur
```
]

---

## Convert to a graph

Using `igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix()`:

.small[
```{r}
cooccur_graph <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(
