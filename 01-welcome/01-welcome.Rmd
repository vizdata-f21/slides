## Themes: what, why, and how

- **What:** the plot
  - Specific types of visualizations for a particular purpose (e.g., maps for spatial data, Sankey diagrams for proportions, etc.) 
  - Tooling to produce them (e.g., specific R packages)

--
- **How:** the process
  - Start with a design (sketch + pseudo code)
  - Pre-process data (e.g., wrangle, reshape, join, etc.)
  - Map data to aesthetics
  - Make visual encoding decisions t(e.g., address accessibility concerns)
  - Post-process for visual appeal and annotation

--
- **Why:** the theory
  - Tie together "how" and "what" through the grammar of graphics

## Lectures

- Lectures will be in person this semester 
  - Recordings will be automatically posted after class

- Attendance is expected (as long as you're healthy!)

- A little bit of everything:
  - Traditional lecture
  - Live coding + demos
  - Short exercises + solution discussion

---

## Labs

- Attendance is expected

- Opportunity to work on course assignments with TA support

- Opportunity to work with teammates on projects

---

## Community participation

- I'll try to do a live stream in alternating weeks for the these two community projects (schedule TBA):
  - [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) - New dataset every week for wrangling, visualizing, modeling
  - [Recreation Thursday](https://twitter.com/_natalie_oshea/status/1400526683170541570) - Piece of art to recreate/remix, every two weeks

- I encourage you to participate, or at a minimum, browse others' contributions on Twitter with [#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday&src=typed_query&f=live) and [#RecreationThursday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RecreationThursday&src=typed_query&f=live)

---

## Announcements

- Posted on Sakai (Announcements tool) and sent via email, be sure to check both regularly

- I'll assume that you've read an announcement by the next "business" day

---

## Diversity and inclusion

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

- If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know! You’ll be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.

- Please let me know your preferred pronouns. You’ll also be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.

- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.

- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

---

## Accessibility

- The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

- I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I’m always learning how to do this better. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don’t hesitate to let me know.

- Homeworks must be completed individually. You may not directly share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice

---

## Sharing / reusing code policy

- We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).

- Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source

## Academic integrity

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:

> - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
> - I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
> - I will act if the Standard is compromised.

## Learning during a pandemic

I want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don’t hesitate to ask.

- You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you’re always welcome to talk to me. If I can’t help, I likely know someone who can.

- I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.

- Feedback on assignments is given as GitHub issues, only points recorded on Sakai gradebook

.task[
Fill out the *Getting to know you* survey for collection of your account names, later this week you will be invited to the course organization.
]

---

## Username advice

.hand[in case you don't yet have a GitHub account...]

Some brief advice about selecting your account names (particularly for GitHub),

- Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with and makes your username easier for people to guess or remember

- Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack

- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss

- Shorter is better than longer, but be as unique as possible

- Make it timeless. Avoid highlighting your current university, employer, or place of residence

---

## GitHub Discussions

.center[.midi[https://github.com/vizdata-f21/discussion/discussions]]

<br>

- Online forum for asking and answering questions

- Private repo in the course organization

- You will need to join the course organization for access

- Ask **and answer** questions related to course logistics, assignment, etc. here

- Personal questions (e.g., extensions, illnesses, etc.) should be via email to me

.task[
Demo on Friday, but it's basically your standard online course discussion forum meets GitHub issues meets StackOverflow/RStudio Community...
